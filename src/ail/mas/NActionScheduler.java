 * Like the ActionScheduler but forces the system to pick a new Jobber

 * which may not be registering as changed information - e.g., the Environment
 * thread has to execute before the perception change is noted.
 * 
 * Not really a good idea to use this one with model checking since the
 * counters will prevent state matching.
